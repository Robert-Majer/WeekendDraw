Weekend Draw is a console application used to draw an idea for the upcoming weekend. It draws one of the items from a list stored in a CSV file. During the draw, we can choose two parameters of the activity for the weekend: whether the activity should be free and whether the activity requires nice weather.


In the application we can also edit the CSV file or prepare it in advance in MS EXCEL.
